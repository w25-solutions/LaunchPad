# Launch Pad - SaaS Base Kit

# Summary

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the design and architecture of Launch Pad, a SaaS starter kit designed to help developers turn ideas into running projects quickly and efficiently. The kit simplifies user authentication, subscription management, and integration with payment and email services.

In the fast-paced world of software development, the ability to quickly launch and scale SaaS applications is crucial. Launch Pad addresses this need by providing a robust and scalable foundation.

## Business Context

Launch Pad will enable startups and developers to focus on their core product features instead of building common SaaS functionalities from scratch.

## Objectives

- To reduce development time for SaaS projects
- To offer scalable and secure user management and subscription services
- To streamline integration with payment and email services

## Scope

- User signup and authentication
- Subscription control
- Stripe integration for handling subscriptions
- SendGrid integration for transactional emails
- JWT authentication, incorporating subscription data

# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- Secure user signup and login
- Efficient subscription management interface
- Seamless Stripe and SendGrid integration

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability to handle growth in user base
- High availability for critical services
- Security measures to protect user data

## Use Cases

- User Registration: A new user can register for an account by providing their email address, creating a password, and verifying their email.
- User Login: A registered user can log in to their account using their email and password.
- Password Reset: Users can reset their password if they forget it, through a secure process that verifies their identity via email.
- Update Profile: Users can update their profile information, including password and email address.
- View Subscription Plans: Users can browse through different subscription plans available and view details about each plan.
- Subscribe: Users can subscribe to a plan, entering payment information through a secure Stripe integration.
- Change Subscription Plan: Users can change their subscription plan, choosing to upgrade or downgrade based on their needs.
- View Subscription History: Users can view their current and past subscriptions, including start dates, end dates, and payment history.
- Cancel Subscription: Users can cancel their subscription, with the option to provide feedback on their reason for cancellation.

- Payment and Email Integration
- Payment Processing: When a user subscribes or changes their subscription, the payment is processed through Stripe, with details of the transaction stored securely.
- Handle Payment Failures: The system automatically handles payment failures, notifying the user and attempting retries as configured.
- Send Transactional Emails: For events like account verification, subscription changes, and payment invoices, the system sends emails through SendGrid.
- Invoice Generation: Upon every successful payment, an invoice is generated and sent to the user's email.
- Subscription Renewal Notifications: Before a subscription renewal, users receive an email notification reminding them of the upcoming charge.
